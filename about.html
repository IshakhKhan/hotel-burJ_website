                        <p>Burj Khalifa (“Khalifa Tower”), known during construction as Burj Dubai, was officially named to honour the leader of the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>
                        <p> Although the tower was formally opened on January 4, 2010, the entirety of the interior was not complete at that time.</p>

                <p>We felt this is one of the things that had to be done but we made the mistake of going on Friday forgetting it is their day off. It was absolutely packed and once you get the lift up it is not very well organised. I would definitely go to the fountains and see it from the outside as its more impressive. The tallest building in the world would definitely surprise me. It's beautiful, very beautiful and adorable, in a great location.</p>

                <p>One of the best piece of architecture in Dubai with the best location. Light show in the evening with musical fountain is amazing. Views from outside and from the top are price less. Must visit place. Superb place from outside view. Dubai Mall is part of Burj Khalifa and visa versa. Best photo opportunity is outer side and right time to visit is at 5.30pm where sunset and night view both can be enjoyed from 124th floor</p>

                <p>Amazing views of Dubai! Really nice journey up to the top with photos of the building process and a very fast elevator ride! They control entry so it never feels crowded. All directions can be viewed from the top. Great gift shop and cafe at the top too! Well you probably can’t go to Dubai without visiting Burj Khalifa, but if you don’t make it, you wouldn’t have missed that much. The views good but it gets crowded. We went in the morning (08:30) to minimise this.</p>
